A FUSE filesystem that mirrors the contents of an M3U playlist into
the mount.  All operations are simply passed through to operate on
the underlying files, and so, this is only meant to work with an M3U
that lists local files.

usage:  m3ufs.py {m3u} --mountpoint {mount} [--emulated_m3u]

This might be useful to you if you would like to do file-like operations
on a playlist, such as rsync, for example.
